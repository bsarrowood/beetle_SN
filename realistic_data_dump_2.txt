Per our conversation, the Individual Application enrollment in goldenrod was designed for new HSA enrollment or recently employer termed HSAs.  There may be opportunity to request a system enhancement (idea in Aha) for a method for moving held up contributions to the enchantments process directly, but as you noted, we don't anticipate a continued need for this use case after the issue is resolved for the member.  In PV, I was able to enroll the member in an HSA under the current employer without issue.  I believe this method will serve the purpose you are after.  If that is not the case please let me know.

Thanks!

close_notes: The Security Team appreciates that printing may be part of your normal workflow when you are in the office, please ask yourself is it part of a business-critical process to print a document while you are working remotely. Unless that document needs to then be sent to a member or partner, or printed and signed for legal reasons, the answer is no. Generally, where that need exists there are many existing processes to accomplish this. To put it simply, printing HealthEquity documents on a remote printer is strictly prohibited unless an approved exception exists. Once a document is printed at a remote location it is very difficult to maintain the security of that document since the security of that document is now outside of the normal physical security protections that HealthEquity has in place at our offices. Please see the linked Company Policies and Corporate Communication information below.

This request will need to include the business critical process is being supported along with the justification for this request.

close_notes: It was complicated to close this PO since it was assigned to a Non-Trade vendor, prior to the Trade vendor ONLY requirement for POs was put in place. Pressing the Close PO button by the business was failing because the PO was assigned to a Non-Trade Vendor. 



To remedy the issue and to close the PO I had to make the following changes:



1) Temporarily change the Vendor to Trade

2) Enable the Custom Form field for the WW Purchase Order form

3) Edit the PO and change the vendor so it reflected the Trade Vendor Type

4) Change the PO form to WW Purchase Order - Admin form

5) Manually check the item Closed check box

6) Save the PO and set o\it to Closed

7) Change the PO form back to WW Purchase Order

8) Edit the WW Purchase Order form and un-select the Custom Form check box

It should work since it looks like it supports 4G/LTE. We would need the IMEI from it once you get it so we can update that with the carrier, if you have the old SIM from the other hotspot and it fits in that new one we may be able to also use that, if not we would just order you a new SIM for your mobile number.

Hi Team, the file vendor for this group is trying to send 2022 enrollment info. They've been submitting enrollment files for 2021 and theyve posted successfully. The file that is coming over continues to reject because there is no 2022 plan code in the "plan code field" I've instructed the vendor to add the plan code numerous times yet the file keeps rejecting. They stated they are not doing anything different then usual.

Can you take a look and see if something is happening in the internal routing causing the plan code to be moved or removed? Ive attached a screenshot of how I see the file record In ER site. The plan code field is blank, however the plan code is listed in a field called User Defined field 3. Why does this file reject if the vendor has not changed their formatting?

Please assign to 'sn_database_mssql'



Please attach all the results back to the ticket

Each script will provide back a table with rejects. Please save it as Excel SS and attach to the ticket. You can combine the results from different scripts in one table per DB.



Start with PRODCXSQL01\CNXDW,12253 ARPA_DB:



1. Execute ARPA_DB_Contact_Insert script on PRODCXSQL01\CNXDW,12253 ARPA_DB

2. As the output from this script you will find one field table with insert statements which then will need to be plugged into attached ARPA_CLOUD_DB_Contact_Insert script below the line '-------------- Regular Inserts' ( You will need this updated script to run on different DB in step8)

3. Second output would show the report of all new contacts created in the ARPA_DB with its corresponding Reg_Code that needs to be attached to this ticket.



4. Execute script ARPA_DB_Removals on PRODCXSQL01\CNXDW,12253 ARPA_DB



5. Execute ARPA_DB_Updates script on PRODCXSQL01\CNXDW,12253 ARPA_DB









-------

Switch to ARPA_CLOUD_DB DB Server: c1-plt-prd-app-sql.database.windows.net





8. Updated ARPA_CLOUD_DB_Contact_Insert script needs to be executed on the ARPA_CLOUD_DB DB Server: c1-plt-prd-app-sql.database.windows.net

DB: hqy.cobra.fedsubsidy2021 and it will provide the output report of all new contacts created in the ARPA_CLOUD_DB with its corresponding Reg_Code that needs to be attached to this ticket.



9. Execute ARPA_CLOUD_DB_Removals script on ARPA_CLOUD_DB DB Server: c1-plt-prd-app-sql.database.windows.net DB: hqy.cobra.fedsubsidy2021



10. Execute ARPA_CLOUD_DB_Updates script on ARPA_CLOUD_DB DB Server: c1-plt-prd-app-sql.database.windows.net DB: hqy.cobra.fedsubsidy2021

close_notes: REQ0037711  appears to have been approved and should have already shipped and is waiting on delivery.  But the Catalog status, what HQY can see in ServiceNow, is really just a count down indicator.  At present, CDW our vendor can not update the order on our side and confirm it is shipped.  



It's a 4 step process.     

- Order placed.

- Approval (once approved.  Order is placed same day and should ship with 24 hours if in stock.)

- Delivery (5 day countdown, and then it marks it delivered)

- Complete



As for returning an order, you can reach out to Rick Hayes with our Vendor Management and see if he can arrange a return.

close_notes: Hello Patricia,



We reviewed the logs and can confirm that the payroll file was delivered on April 5th to the FTP site by the Payroll Manager, the file was uploaded to the following folder: 	/Home/WPP/outbound



Typically a file uploaded to the Outbound folder will remain available for download for approximately 14 days however according to the logs we see that FTP user "wpp06" downloaded a copy of the file on 04/11 and then deleted the file from the Outbound folder. So the file was delivered and retrieved and looking at that user account it looks like it is an account used by vendor ADP to access the WPP client folder as the technical contact we have on file for that FTP user is Sneha.Yadav@adp.com





Ticket Resolved - If you think that this ticket has been closed in error, please email inbound@healthequity.com with the number and the reason you are requesting the ticket to be reopened.



Thank you.

Hi Rifelle and Juan,  I am not that familiar with this end so wanted to check with you guys.  We are working with TTEC on this and at this time they would like to create a new team HerbertPaulCX2 that would mirror the original and then delete the original.  Because I don't know,  Is this a path we can take as a next steps or would this cause any issues to any reporting?  Thanks

Adding Fred to get his take on this as well.  Fred,  would creating a HerbertPaulCX2 team to mirror and then deleting the original  cause any issue with reporting?  I am not that familiar on if their would be any impact with creating the new team.



Ganesh, if Fred doesn't see an issue, I would be able to test visibility after you have completed the work.  Thanks

Hi Daniel- I think the best option would be is to create 'team 'HerbertPaulCX2' and make it mirror image of 'team 'HerbertPaulCX' and then proceed with 'team HerbertPaulCX' deletion.  If TTEC is doing this then I'll have to get a change opened and get it CAB approved.



Would tomorrow night 10 PM CST be fine for this change? We also need someone from WW side to test this post completion.

Angelica Duran worked with Oscar on Friday, and I guess they decided to ship her replacement laptop to her parents address instead of her own address since she wasn't going to be home, but the laptop hasn't arrived at her parents address and she is going back to her normal address tonight, 4/24/2021.  So she is requesting we update the shipping to go to her normal address.   If it goes to her parents, she will not be able to get it.

I'm thinking this may have been intentional or we may need a system enhancement. I'm going to refer you to Joe Gardner and resolve the ticket. If Joe recommends this be represented as a bug, let me know and send this ticket number over and I will revisit.

Thanks!

We restarted the laptop and tried all 3 again and still received the DNS error

We shut down the laptop and performed a hard reset and retried all 3. DNS error

We tried a modem reboot and still DNS error on all 3.



Aaliyah said she also spoke with her ISP and troubleshooted her connection last night and her ISP said something is wrong with her modem and were needing to send her a new one.



With all the troubleshooting we performed on the call as well as her ISP input stating the modem is not working properly, only resolution is waiting on a new modem from her ISP.

description: The Data Engineering team is looking to use a Sentry One add-on for SSMS that allows them to open query plans directly from within SSMS.  Prior to installing this software I wanted to reach out and make sure that the software add-on is vetted.  If it is not vetted I would like to work with someone from Technical Security to have the software vetted.  The software is a free add-on to Sentry One and Sentry One is vetted, or at least it should be considering that it has been in use before I started working for HealthEquity a year and a half ago....meaning Sentry One, which is a stand along performance monitoring tool used by the operational DBAs and the EDW DBAs....it is the add-on (Sentry One Query Plan Explorer) that we would need to have vetted if it is not vetted.  If it is vetted could you please provide or point me in the direction to where I can obtain proof that it is vetted.  Please let me know if there are any questions or concerns.  Thanks.

close_notes: Hey Ben, 



Unfortunately, I was unable to determine why employer is reporting they aren't receiving file processed email notifications but system (database) shows we are sending them. This is the only ER reporting so I wonder if emails are just being sent but emails are going to their junk or spam folder. I'm assuming they've already checked in those folders and I'm also assuming that it's every admin user listed below is not getting the emails, not only Alison. (For each contribution file upload employer made, we're seeing that file processed emails are generated and sent out to following emails.) I'm currently working "BUG 76344: PLACEHOLDER: Employer admins not receiving "File Processed by HealthEquity" emails after successfully uploading contribution files on portal" to address this issue. Will notify PO once bug is finalized and assigned to the correct development team. I'll Teams you to update you once Product team has been notified.

close_notes: Posted the following in Teams to inform the Team of this change.  As I approached actually performing the backing up portion of this request it suddenly struck me that backing up each branch to its environmental counterpart (dev, release, prod) was not the best approach.  For one it spreads the backups across to many environments making them hard to manage and keep track of.  Second, there are branches that are not necessarily named in accordance with its environment.  To resolve these shortcomings I decided to back up the repos on SDEDW01A.dev.healthequity.com and include all branches.  I created the following directory to contain the backed up repos prior to deleting from TFS:  C:\codebase\tfs\DataManagement\Repo_Backups_Created_20210702\. 



That directory is where the backups will live until it is decided that we no longer need them for historical purposes.  Again, to clarify...the repos, including all branches, cited on INC0134801 have been backed up SDEDW01A.dev.healthequity.com and deleted from TFS.  Let me know if there are any questions or concerns.  Thanks All.

Good afternoon,

How are you doing on this lovely Wednesday? We're almost over the hump!  I wanted to put in a ticket on behalf of Jana Isaacson concerning Motivosity.

She is a further teammate, who should be able to use the same credentials she uses for SSO with Motivosity. All of her other accounts in OKTA work well however she is not being redirected to our SSO when she attempts to get to the site via web address or OKTA. Her credentials are jaisaacson@healthequity.com for Motivosity. She is using her HQY laptop.

The one and only Megan Kendall has been crushing these issues lately like a pro!. If you get stuck with this can you please reach out to her and Taylor MacMillan as they are absolute SUPERSTARS and can handle wrestle these issues faster than a cat lapping chain lightning.

Thank you so much and have a great rest of your day,

Zach Cuppy

When you have an opportunity, could you please help me with accessing the call feature on the Jabber application? I attempted to follow the instructions in fetch but was not able to locate the call option in the settings.



In addition, I am getting the error message in my emails again when I attempt to search my "All mailboxes" and I receive duplicate email notifications. I have recently changed my password and am not sure if that is what affected my email.



Thank you so much for all of your help! I am sorry to be such a bother. Have a wonderful rest of your night.

INC0236555

With my prior resolution notes in mind our additional findings are that this group is using a third part to make this call and had some opportunity to have an incorrect account number.  Per our teams chat the request for this information is delayed pending approval to waive the associated fees.  Given those constraints, per our teams chat, please send us a new ticket and include this INC# in the event that we find the account number was not the cause.  I have prepared a SPIKE for development in this ticket in the event that is the case for a quick turnaround.

Thanks!

This could be a relative or friend's place.  However, I am aware this is probably not feasible as you have communicated.  The next is to explore using a MiFI device.  As you have communicated to me, you will need to raise this subject with your leader.  In the meantime, per your request, I have switched you back to GlobalProtect.  I have also confirmed how to connect to Finesse which is through OKTA using the chrome shortcuts on the desktop that was placed by IT in a previous project.

[6/24 11:29 AM] Evan Swick

    Good Morning Samantha, I'm with desktop services.  You called and left a voicemail with the helpdesk a week and half ago before going out of office, and requested return labels for some equipment?   I am needing to see how many return labels you are needing?  Also are there boxes to go with all this equipment?  

​[6/24 11:31 AM] Samantha Sianava

    I just got the return label for my lap top and will be having that sent back. I have my two monitors and old doc here that have no return labels and the boxes that my new monitors came in they don't fit in the fom to keep them safe in travel. 

​[6/24 11:35 AM] Evan Swick

    That's okay.  In all honesty, they will not be reissued or redeployed in any form if returned.  If damaged, it's of little concern as they will just be going to eRecycle anyways.  If you like, you are actually welcome to keep the monitors, as we do not require their return, only the laptop.

​[6/24 11:36 AM] Evan Swick

    Otherwise, basic paper padding or breaking up the styrofoam to secure the monitor within the box is fine and I can get you some return labels for them.



No further response.  Closing task. 



If  you would like to proceed further, please respond to this ticket notification to reopen the ticket.

My computer forced the restart to update Windows 10 and when I rebooted the software for my new equipment started installing and running through the process as soon as my laptop rebooted. I was asked to reboot again to finish the install and restarted the computer. However, now nothing is working properly with my keyboard, mouse or Headset, it has made my afternoon client calls difficult.



Is there a way someone can finish the installation of the software and get my new equipment working again so I can function properly and be ready to go for my client calls tomorrow?



Thanks,

Thank you,

I think this error is just cause she's not signed into Salesforce before clicking the link to use it.  As long as she has them both open it would work. Please have her try again with both programs open in the same browser window and let us know if still an issue.

Hello-



They are all set up in Complink to use their HQY\ logons and they should be logging on to CEI automatically with their HQY\ credentials.   They need to open Salesforce and CEI in the same chrome browser window for the CRM case link to work. We should not change anyone back to use wageworks\ for any member service agents. 



Thank you,

I apologize for the confusion. Whatever you all did to grant the teammates access to CEI yesterday is the same thing I would need you to do for Laura Silva's access. I was going off of what mine says when I log into CEI because mine shows "wageworks\dahoward".



Again my apologies

Good Morning All,



Jason is out on PTO so I am stepping in for his class today. Upon doing some navigation practice this morning teammate Irma Laura Silva is having issues accessing accounts still. She says they are grayed out when she logs into CEI regularly or using the incognito workaround. Can we grant her access please? They will be taking the final today and some of the questions require the use of CEI. Thank you team for your help with this!

Hi Chuck-



Tip is working on updating all of the agents from wageworks\ in Complink to HQY\ so CEI will work effectively.  I'm working with the team on the best way to address this as not all teammates are added to Complink using HQY\ accounts due to some requiring OKTA.  It does appear that all of MS needs this set up exactly as this so we are covering documenting that right now and ensuring all on the team are aware of this process change for Complink access creations.  As additional changes are made with OKTA and other systems, we should have everyone being set up the same way soon to avoid any future challenges like this. 



We are working through these updates at this time and will follow up as soon as everyone is updated to use HQY\ for complink which will resolve the CEI error. 



Let me know if any questions in the meantime, update coming shortly once resolved for these teammates.  



Thank you,

description: Claims is in the process of creating a concierge service in which we will have TMs proactively call members regarding their denied claims. We do not want them calling from their direct lines as we do not want to open the door for members to call any one person directly regarding their claims related questions. Therefore, we’d like to have a separate extension that can be used instead. This would be for outbound and inbound calling. This should be a separate extension than my existing personal desk extension.

As announced in the 7/27 Purple Pulse, all access requests for SOX applications need to follow a new process. Please use the "I Need Access" form located here to request access and it will auto-route to your leader for approval before going to IT for processing:

https://healthequity.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=dee888851b976090aae0eb96624bcbbc



If you do not see your application listed in the drop-down list, please check the box beneath it that says "The Application/System Access I Need is Not Listed" and type in the name of the application/system in the now empty box above it.

The HCSz password for these two teammates have been reset and emailed to you from our shared mailbox. 



The following are the minimum requirements for creating an HCSz system password:



•         Must be eight characters, no blanks or spaces

•         Must use one alpha and one numeric character

•         Must include one of the following National characters: @  #  $

•         The three National characters cannot be at the beginning or end of the password

•         Passwords must be changed at your normal password change interval and cannot be changed again within 1 day of the last change

•         You may not reuse a password that you have used in the previous 16 password iterations

•         You cannot use your user id as a part of your password

•         You cannot use three repeating characters



Review carefully as the site does not tell you the requirements or what is missing when you select a new/confirm password.  If you do not meet the requirements it simply states inconsistent user ID combo.



Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.  Thanks!

close_notes: Hello Harshini,



The only FTP folder we were able to locate was for client "Brown Shoe Company" however while reviewing it we confirmed that this folder has no active FTP accounts as they most likely expired and were removed from the site due to inactivity so there is no FTP access to terminate. Additionally, we ran logs for the two files that were listed in the ticket however no results appeared when checking the past 90+ days. Usually when we cannot find any activity for the past 90 days with the file name, this indicates that the file was uploaded to the Employer site instead of our FTP site as there is an option to do this for PSF files. We will go ahead and close this ticket as no further actions can be taken on our end.

close_notes: Hi Yuri,

INC0093981

Please keep record of this issue for future reference.  I've attached a workbook to the ServiceNow ticket that will help if future instances of this issue occur.  This was caused by a manually created scheduled item and associated stop pay that was issued through the ACH Reject report Custom Funding processes.  Payment should not be issued for denials and as such should not be on the ACH Reject report.  We believe the initial payment was a manual error and will not pursue a development ask for this issue at this time.  I want to revisit this if we see a reoccurrence.  Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks!

close_notes: Hi Kristin,

INC0037580

This issue would be a system enhancement request as the system was not designed to load the homepage for a cash card only member once the cash card account has been closed.  Please submit an idea in Aha to request this functionality and include details on the business need for this functionality as well as the following query:



SELECT TOP 10 HeldFor FROM Subaccount

WHERE SubaccountType = 'CashCard'

AND Closed = '1'

AND HeldFor NOT IN

    (SELECT HELDFOR FROM Subaccount WHERE Closed = '0')

ORDER BY AuditInfo_CreatedAt DESC



One way this scenario can occur is through other account closures.  This is not the only way this can occur but I wanted to include the related work item for reference:

User Story 77916:Prevent CashCards from being closed when selecting "All" in the account closure screen







Please let me know if you have any questions.







Thanks!

Ms. Christmas has been migrated to a new Lenovo laptop and has received a Lenovo pro dock 2, however, she has the older viewsonic monitors.  One monitor is currently connected to her old dock via VGA and the other with a DVI cable, which I believe is a DVD-D, single Link 19-pin (snip attached).    Please send Ms. Christmas 1 VGA-to-DP adapter and 1 DVD-D single link 19-pin to-DP, as it is difficult to tell whether or not these particular monitors have the DP connectors.

close_notes: Hi Anne,



This email was being generated by CX via a manual process now owned by the Report Team led by Heather Whiting. Our transition from CX to Salesforce discontinued any automation from CX and should have been captured as a requirement for Salesforce. Per our Application Admin, Erik Henley, the current Product Owners for Salesforce are Eric Boie and Lauren Godfrey. Because Salesforce is a third party application this is managed outside of our traditional development support structure I need to refer you to Eric Boie and Lauren Godfrey for next steps. They should be able to address this issue either by adding the requirement to the backlog for Salesforce or partner with you on getting this reinstated in CX with Erik Henley. If you run into any issues please don't hesitate to reach out. I am closing the ticket.



Thanks!

close_notes: The Security Team appreciates that printing may be part of your normal workflow when you are in the office, please ask yourself is it part of a business-critical process to print a document while you are working remotely. Unless that document needs to then be sent to a member or partner, or printed and signed for legal reasons, the answer is usually no. Generally, where that need exists there are many existing processes to accomplish this. To put it simply, printing HealthEquity documents on a remote printer is strictly prohibited unless an approved exception exists. Once a document is printed at a remote location it is very difficult to maintain the security of that document since the security of that document is now outside of the normal physical safeguards and protections that HealthEquity has in place at our offices. Please see the linked Company Policies and Corporate Communication information below.

If you feel that there is still a legitimate business need to print documents while working remotely, your leader will need to submit a request through ServiceNow on your behalf requesting this access. All requests for access need to follow the new process outlined in the Purple Pulse on 7/27/21. Please use the "I Need Access" form located here to request access and it will auto-route to your leader for approval before going to IT for processing:

https://healthequity.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=dee888851b976090aae0eb96624bcbbc

 

Please check the box labeled 'The Application/System Access I Need is Not Listed'

 

In the 'Application/System Requested' field

'Remote Printing using USB Printer'

 

In the 'Type of Access' field

'Remote Printing using USB Printer'



In the 'Business Reason' field please be sure to include the following information:

	· This request requires approval by the Data Protection Security Team and fulfillment by the Technology Security Engineering Team

	· The business critical process that is being supported

	· What documents will be printed and with what frequency

	· The intended audience for these documents

	· How long you anticipate documents to exist before destruction

	· Any additional information as justification for this request

This information will be considered and reviewed before approval and additional information may be required. If approved, the exceptions will be added to the company risk register and the team members will be added to the appropriate security group. 



After approval, the necessary equipment will need to be requested and purchased for the team members. This will include the printer as well as a paper shredder. Please do not submit hardware requests until the access is approved. Keep this link for reference.

description: We had opened ticket INC0047589 last year for someone to assist a teammate, Mary Bradley, with an ADA accommodation where she needed to have the font on her computer changed to be black print on white background. It sounds like this still has not been corrected and is causing issues with her being able to successfully use the platforms. It sounds like majority of her platforms default to grey and lavender print, which is causing strains. She advised that someone from IT did work with her previously (I believe it was Evan) however it sounds like this didn't get fully completed on all platforms. Can someone please set-up an appointment with Mary to walk through this and get her system set-up to default to black on white background for all programs?

If the client sends data over on a file that matches to what is currently in Correlation, the modifiedfrom file name will not change since the file did not make any changes to the record.



As for the hire date vs effective date, the Eligibility file mapping for the CoverageSpan records does not contain a separate field for hire date vs start date. The partner is filling in the Start Date field with the hire date. See the attached screenshot for Frank Ash.

description: Hello,



I received my new laptop about a week ago, I was unable to set it up because of tech issues, I was instructed to either set up a time to come in and have the laptop set up or ship it to you guys. Unfortunately someone in my house had tested positive for COVID and I did not want to put anyone at risk, we are now out of quarantine. I was wondering what my next steps would be, am I able to run the laptop to Draper to have you guys set it up or do you want me to ship it in? Here are some Service Desk Ticket IDs related to the issue: INC0048969 and INC0049053.

Hey Berkley,



I'm seeing member's total contribution for 2020 tax year $6874.18. However portal reflects total contributions for members for 2020 is $7970.36 - that's including 2 individual contributions made in January 2020 and May 2020 but posted to 2019 tax year. I looked at the 5498SA forms for member for 2020 tax year and I'm seeing first 2 forms with BOX2 amount $7970.36 and the last form generated being reported as the issue with FMV (677.79) amount added is $8648.15. Can you tell me how we're calculating the BOX2 amount - is $7970.36 correct or it should be $6874.18? What are the amounts we're expecting to see in the form? Also, can you provide details on how we calculate the FMV cash amount? It's showing $677.79, I"m seeing there is a contribution of the same amount but I'm not sure if that's the amount we're pulling in.

Access to ps1 claim center and service site still shows enabled under username: JHOLLENBECK



Production data overwrites PS1 twice weekly (Typically Wed. and Sunday night), if you've recently made a password change in production it may be pending to push to PS1. You can reset your PS1 password via the forgot username/password option on PS1 Service Site, however, the password set would function only until Production data overwrites PS1 with the Prod password.



Thank you!

I'm submitting an urgent service ticket on behalf of Bill. The IT person handling this needs to create an actual meeting using Scheduling Assistant to work with Bill's schedule—he can't do "pop-up" meetings. We need a dedicated time and rep to assist with remote access for saving his current documents and then for the migration. This is a horribly busy time for the Onboarding team, so great care needs to be taken not to lose time (or documents) on this migration.

understand what is going on. Everything is moving really slow the MS Teams takes around 3 minutes to recognize the call that is coming in. The user was able to take one phone call that was okay and then after that things got wacky. 



The use called in on Monday about the same issue and it seemed fixed. The user is unsure if it is the computer or the headset at this moment, and was told by a lead to order another headset. User has 3 headset which all have the same 



problem. The user did a hard reset this morning and is pretty tech savvy. The user has already reset Jabber, checked Jabber and on the System. The user noted the laptop has ran weird since they had the laptop. The user's tickets on Monday 



12/20 are 19013643 and 19014944 in which driver updates were ran for Lenovo, Realtek, and Intel display. Cleared app data cached, reset Jabber, and switched headsets. System was restarted multiple times as well as hard reset for laptop and

The carry forward credits in the amount of $247.74 were applied resulting in a pretax amount of $0.

A custom program runs to apply the Subsidy based on qualified Zip Codes



I do not  want the same error to occur for the September 2021 Benefit month and the cutoff for this Plan is TODAY (August 4th)!



Please explain what caused the August 2021 Benefit Month error to occur and what you are doing to make sure this same error does not occur for the September 2021 Benefit Month.



The WageWorks EE IDs affected for the August 2021 Benefit Month were:

23728017

43998293

53303052

39402539

15238659

15247387

35087913



Since September 2021 rolls up tonight -- I am unable to identify all the EE IDs impacted but would estimate that the count would be between 10 and 15 EEs.



It is critical that you get the September 2021 Benefit Month to process correctly and apply the UBS Special Subsidy of $170.24 and take no more than $77.50 (less applicable pre-tax EE credits  not generated by Subsidy Credit returned)!



Thank you!

Subject: Re: Vpay Access requests



Hi Angela, 



The request is for V5 and I submitted these tickets after talking with Mindy as TM's have already been set up for them in VPay itself however they are all blocked from reaching the site. Mindy advised it appears to be a VPN issue that is not allowing them to gain access to the site. TM have tried accessing the site using multiple browsers and even tried incognito mode and still receive a error message stating site cannot be accessed.

description: Since completion of the O365 migration for Further teammates, I have had many strange experiences in Outlook and O365 generally. This morning, after updates applied in a push to O365 apps yesterday, I have now lost visibility to all of the mail folders that were brought over in the migration for Further users.



I don't know if this is related to the issue, but my system seems to have two identically named .OST files, one of which is significantly larger than the other (4GB vs. 16MB).  Is this a situation where the local cache is being rebuilt and will eventually "catch up" to what is in the cloud?  If that were the case, should I not see these file sizes changing? I have observed for 30 minutes and have seen no change... see attached screenshot.

Hi Team,



I submitted a ticket for getting the keyboard and mouse combo on 6/7/2021. And I got the email below yesterday saying the Combo is being delivered. I didn't receive any package yesterday. And when I go into the ticket, I didn't see any notes about it. Could you please help me check where did it delivered to? Or it just means the ticket is received by you guys and it will be worked on by some teammate?



Thank you,

Please attach all the results back to the ticket

Each script will provide back a table with rejects. Please save it as Excel SS and attach to the ticket. You can combine the results from different scripts in one table per DB.



Start with PRODCXSQL01\CNXDW,12253 ARPA_DB:



1. Execute ARPA_DB_Contact_Insert script on PRODCXSQL01\CNXDW,12253 ARPA_DB

2. As the output from this script you will find one field table with insert statements which then will need to be plugged into attached ARPA_CLOUD_DB_Contact_Insert script below the line '-------------- Regular Inserts' ( You will need this updated script to run on different DB in step8)

3. Second output would show the report of all new contacts created in the ARPA_DB with its corresponding Reg_Code that needs to be attached to this ticket.



4. Execute script ARPA_DB_Update_Client_Pricing_new on PRODCXSQL01\CNXDW,12253 ARPA_DB





-------

Switch to ARPA_CLOUD_DB DB Server: c1-plt-prd-app-sql.database.windows.net





5. Updated ARPA_CLOUD_DB_Contact_Insert script needs to be executed on the ARPA_CLOUD_DB DB Server: c1-plt-prd-app-sql.database.windows.net

DB: hqy.cobra.fedsubsidy2021 and it will provide the output report of all new contacts created in the ARPA_CLOUD_DB with its corresponding Reg_Code that needs to be attached to this ticket.

close_notes: Hi Jacob,



Our secure email system is constantly running automatically to scan email for possible sensitive data. It's possible that is just happened to flag something in the email/subject as sensitive data if it just matched the format it scans for although it was not sensitive. 



There is no way to turn this off so if you get a reply like this, the system just found something that it thinks is sensitive data. It would be best to just resend the email but add the word "Secure" in the subject to automatically encrypt the data. This should not affect the ability for anyone to view the content once the email is delivered. 



I hope this information helps

Hi team,



Please perform a full termination for the accounts in the attached email. These were requested to be disabled by Julie Potts/Chad Brown/Paul Mahnke per INC0189715 as part of the FY Q3 2022 WageWorks Domain user access certification.



I have disabled the agents in WageWorks Active Directory but access exists everywhere else and I did not pull application listings – so please process as regular Conduent/ADP terminations.

Brian Dajany and I are working today in preparation for some board meetings.  When Brian went to boot up his machine today it would not boot all the way up.  He is getting a specific message that he can share with you, but I wanted to see if we can get this prioritized as he is unable to work without a machine.  I know that his machine is very old and may need replacement.  If he requires a replacement machine, how long might that take?  Here is Brian's contact info, please give him a call at your earliest convenience:

short_description: VMWare/ Okta Password Reset Issue - Earlene Craig
work_notes: 

close_notes: Hi Sierra,



If the fans are picking up, it's usually due to an increase in temperature. This could be caused by some updates that may be installing in the background causing the computer to use more power than normal. This happens occasionally and is normal.



If this seems to be happening a lot more than it used to, there could possibly be something obstructing the exhaust for the laptop causing heat to linger. When you are able, you can check vents on the laptop for dust or debris and blow them away with some canned air. Be sure to also keep your laptop in a well ventilated area and on a hard surface such as wood or plastic. Carpet or soft materials can prevent proper air flow.



I hope this info helps! Thank you.

these reports are accessed through a browser at http://bdhqyblk01.hqy.network/Reports/browse/



ideally this access would be granted to hqy\mbates but may require a new account. it may also be possible to add this access to hqy\wa_mbates.



this is the link i was given to the specific report that i am looking for. my need is to be able to generate this report adhoc as needed.

when this website resolves it resolves to a SQL Server Reporting Services page it appears that the access i need may be a subscription to this page.



Levi Carroll has this access and uses this process to access the site... 



'the way I launch the browser is to use my WA (Workstation Admin) account, then once I launch the website I have to enter my SA (Server Admin) account and creds.'



i do not have an SA_ account at this time. if this is the account that is required, this request is for whatever account or permissions on that account are needed to gain access to this site.

Hi Angela, 



The request is for V5 and I submitted these tickets after talking with Mindy as TM's have already been set up for them in VPay itself however they are all blocked from reaching the site. Mindy advised it appears to be a VPN issue that is not allowing them to gain access to the site. TM have tried accessing the site using multiple browsers and even tried incognito mode and still receive a error message stating site cannot be accessed.

Team avatar is going to work in migrating the ticketing system from Oracle CX to ServiceNow. We are looking at Service Now REST API to accomplish the feature by pushing incidents/tickets through the REST API calls. To perform REST API calls to ServiceNow, our team would like the following information. If ServiceNow team can provide some insight into calling the REST API it would be help our team to accomplish the work easily. 



1) Rest API Urls for both Test and Production ServiceNow environments.

2) What is the security requirement for pushing tickets into ServiceNow? Any OepnId Connect/Authentication requirement to call Rest API? SAML2.0? SSO?

3) User & Credentials that need to be used to call the ServiceNow REST API.

Lisa Huffman and Jared Lee are experiencing this:

It asks her to lock her computer and enter her password. She exits out of the message and keeps working. Jared Lee said he experiences something similar if not the exact same. Lisa said that she is going to grab a screenshot next time it happens.

Hi Charles, I was asked to advise you to switch to a wired connection instead of using wireless. Is that possible for you to do?

Not at this time. Why would I need to switch to a wired connection?

Based on the network connectivity scores of Teams and Outlook on your machine, your network connectivity/experience is poor. Have you been having trouble with any of your Office apps?



[Yesterday 8:37 AM] Charles Bowen

No sir. I wasn't having any problems until I got this message from Matt Blake: Hey Charles,Security has informed us that they have received reports of the Wave Browser being installed on your machine, and it is known Maleware so isn't approved for use on HealthEquity devices. "It doesn't require admin rights to install and does all sorts of bad things: https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/60937bee0757edc496498434The software puts files and other tasks in place so that it reinstalls itself after you try to uninstall it. Please reach out to immediately wipe their computers with a fresh start."We can remotely send the command to reset your device, so please let me know when we can do that ASAP to limit any data breaches, and I will attach instructions so you will be able to re-provision your laptop after I send the command to reset it.  When Matt did the reset on my system, it converted me from Cisco - VPN to GlobalProtect - VPN, that is when all of my issues began.

Please ensure that all certificates are ASCII (Base64) encoded

I will need the full cert chain -All certificates from the root through intermediates must be present on a server in order for its newly signed certificate to remain valid.

close_notes: Hello Sucharitha,



We reviewed the FTP folder for client "Michael Aram Inc" however no PSF folder was found so there is no FTP access to terminate for PSF/FSA files. At the moment this client folder on the FTP site is only uploading Cobra files. Additionally, we ran logs for the file that was listed in the ticket however no results appeared when checking the past 60+ days. Usually when we cannot find any activity for the past 60 days with the file name, this indicates that the file was uploaded to the Employer site instead of our FTP site as there is an option to do this for PSF files. We will go ahead and close this ticket as no further actions can be taken on our end.





Ticket Resolved - If you think that this ticket has been closed in error, please email inbound@healthequity.com with the number and the reason you are requesting the ticket to be reopened.



Thank you.

description: It has been identified that if we were able to download a plugin for adobe called "file splitter" then it would shorten one of our monthly tasks from an hour and a half to just a few minutes, can I get authorization to download this plug-in? It would be beneficial for the rest of the Custom Invoicing team to have the plug-in as well.



This is the plugin: https://www.evermap.com/AutoSplit.asp.



The functionality we were looking for in the filesplitter plugin is as follows:



1.	Searches for a specific string of text to signal the beginning of a new PDF file (in this case it would be the phrase "Page 1 of" since the parent file includes invoices of variable lengths)

2.	Separates the PDF file into variable lengths based on the appearance of the queried text string (that way if an invoice is 6 pages long, the filesplitter would not start a new PDF file until the first page of a new invoice)

3.	Allows for files to be named based on a variable that is identified in each file (For example, based on the legal name of the company as it appears on the invoice and the month listed on the invoice)



The google chrome functionality is similar to the manual process we already utilize for this process.

1.    Place the stop payment (see above). (Skip this step if not a reissue)



Note: Skip step 2 if the member gives permission to send immediately and there are sufficient funds.



2.    Wait for funds to come back to the account (usually 2-4 business days.)



3.    Create a new claim using the correct address for the provider.



4.    Send the payment.



Let us know if you have any other questions!

description: HMA is having issues uploading files to our FTP from their network. Can you please review the below and advise if their IP is being blocked somehow?

Just a little more context, we performed more network testing and determined any connection attempts from our side that come from this IP address are being blocked. Any connections from other IP’s (we tried 139.138.55.12, and outside our corporate network) seem to work. Our firewall logs indicate that the connection is being broken from the server/remote side.

Seems like maybe the IP has been blacklisted or some security measure is kicking in and preventing the connection. Apparently this was working last week at some point, and we haven’t made any network/firewall changes on our side recently. I’m happy to talk to a network/firewall/engineering resource on your side if it helps get down to the bottom of it, just let me know!

close_notes: Hi Ashlee,



I received an escalation through my leadership team regarding incorrect emails for two Intermountain Healthcare members with concern this may be a more widespread issue.  These escalations should be reported as described in our Bug Request Process fetch page (https://fetch.healthequity.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2360/kw/bug).  Please note that Member Services has a modified process (linked at the top of the page) that provides instruction on how to engage with the MS Defect submission process.



I have reviewed the escalation and I believe the system is working as expected.



Member 1243301 (michael.lamoreaux@imail.org) had their email removed on 10/09/2020 - likely due to a correlation file being received without the email.  The incorrect email was delivered 12/02/2020 at 9:32 p.m.  Email address michael.lamoreaux@imail.org was reintroduced to our system 12/02/2020 at 10:49 p.m. and the email has not yet been verified.



Member 8805799 (kirstin.harris@imail.org) had their email removed on 10/8/2020 - likely due to a correlation file being received without the email.  The incorrect email was delivered 12/02/2020 at 3:35 p.m.  Email address kirstin.harris@imail.org was reintroduced to our system 12/02/2020 at 10:15 p.m. and the email has not yet been verified.



I have also reviewed a number of @imail.org emails that have recently received the HealthEquity access request – incorrect email - all of which are not currently in our system.



The October eligibility file from SelectHealth removed just over 15 thousand email addresses.  The Service Delivery Manger, Christopher Nygard,  mentioned this is related SelectHealth's move to Workday.   He is reaching out to SelectHealth to ensure the next eligibility file includes any email addresses needing to be restored.



Unverified emails are commonly changes via enrollment file.  Of the approximate 15 thousand impacted members, only 199 members have ever logged in.



Please let me know if you have any questions about any of the information above.



Thanks!

I believe the First Time flow was abandoned initially which set the date Authentication_FirstLoginDate.  Then the member came back but was not found in the First Time Login population.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
description: I have no idea why Christopher Derose (Member ID: 21781813) was able to successfully complete the first time login process and why Rebecca Guyski (Member ID: 21823961) received an error after clicking next on the first screen. Please see the screen shot below. I appreciate any additional insights you can provide.

Rebecca Guysky has since completed first time login but please compare the two examples and see if we can figure out why  one was able to do it themselves and the other had to call in.

close_notes: We've done a little bit more digging and it looks like there are already several active bug reports for this issue, Bug 59550 and Bug 122693. It looks like Dev is working on improving error reporting so that clients know exactly what is causing the "Validation Unsuccessful" message and can fix the contribution issue on their file.



Because this has already been reported, there unfortunately isn't much that Spending Accounts can assist with on this case. We'd recommend that you continue taking these issues to Funding Ops for the time being. Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns.

Subject: RE: CSAM Migration: Joseph T Ryerson (53570) - RITM0025586



No, there is nothing at all special about this group for the re-instatement process for this group AND we are not going to reinstate services on CSAMS.  They need to move them over to V5 for the go forward process / method and follow the standard process we created for the suspension .   



I will send an email to both the SDM and her manager on the reinterment process.  



To confirm based off the askes in the tickets and your questions  – 

•	CSAMS will NOT be reactivated for this client.  

•	PRO data was already loaded on 9/15, so from this perspective, the SDM / Client will be responsible for getting any addition PRO records added manually to V5 (outside of DIS 😊)

•	SDM will need to put in a new ticket to request a re-route of any files over to V5.  No action will be taken for that request in the current ticket.   



Thanks!

close_notes: Followed up with Greg this morning.   Had recommended hard lining has laptop to connect to the HealthEquity VPN, but that did not appear to resolve this issue with his VPN failing to connect.  



As I was discussing it with him, Greg tried connecting under the Purple Teammates Group Profile and was successfully able to connect, but was still unable to connect to Employees afterwards.  After investigating further with Oscar Juarez and Richard Potter, we determined that the Employee's VPN group profile is still authenticating under the old HEQ domain, while the Purple Teammates authenticates through the new HQY domain.  Oscar found that Greg's HEQ domain account was locked and unlocked it.



Greg tested connecting to the Employee Profile again and was able to successfully connect.  The issue is resolved but we need to be aware that the different VPN profile groups are authenticating against varying Domains, some of which we do not necessarily have full or easy visibility into in order to check accounts and we very well may be seeing more of this in the future until the VPN consolidation and migration is completed.  I have apprised the team for future reference.
