close_notes: Hello David,

Based on the screenshot that you sent, I can see that the link you are trying to access is to a file or folder in Tyson Wanlass' personal OneDrive. In order to get access to this, he will need to share the file/folder with you from within his OneDrive. He can do this by right-clicking the item and choosing Share from the menu, then filling out the details to share it with you. Once this has been done, you should be able to access this.

Thank you,

Hi Sandra,

I do apologize but the email you have sent your request to does not handle member accounts. If you received this email from a Member Services agent, they were unfortunately mistaken and you will need to contact Member Services directly for assistance with your card.  You can use the options below for assistance and once again, I apologize for the confusion. A case will be opened with Member Services management to ensure it does not happen again. Thank you,

description: Action is required only if you have selected SAML 2.0 as a Single Sign-On type in Setup. If you are not using SAML 2.0 for Single Sign-On, no action is required.

We want to make sure you are aware of upcoming changes to the Workfront SAML 2.0 certificate. Mismatched certificates can keep your users from logging in to Workfront.

Our records indicate that you have SAML 2.0 selected as a Single Sign-On type in Setup. The Workfront servers utilize the SAML 2.0 protocol for authentication and authorization, and our SAML 2.0 security certificate will be expiring soon. We plan to update the old certificate with its replacement on November 5, 2020.

To ensure uninterrupted Workfront services for your account users, please update the existing certificate anytime between now and November 5, 2020. For information about how to update the certificate, see the follow article: https://one.workfront.com/s/document-item?bundleId=workfront-classic&topicId=Content%2FAdministration_and_Setup%2FManage_Workfront%2FSecurity%2Frenew-wf-saml-2-certificate.htm

description: I am having difficulties with OneNote again. Back in early September, I was unable to launch the program (INC0035997 – OneNote). Today the program launched but was unresponsive. I could not make an update, move between tabs or minimize.  It would not even close. I finally used Task Manager to close the program.  I tried relaunching multiple times and each time I have needed to use Task Manager to close.

Launching again brought up a screen with a message that the program did not launch successfully last time and three possibilities:

1.      Launch again – tried and was not successful

2.      Clear  (or something similar) – tried and not successful

3.      Revert to standard settings (or something similar) – brought me to a screen that said Loading- please wait. According to Task Manager, CPU usage was changing so I let it run on this screen in the background for about 5 or 6 hours. Still running, and I am going to end the session now.

Hi Michelle and Suzanne, I am able to access the site currently without issue.  I am on KCVPN at the moment.  I know they were doing maintenance on the site over the weekend, and sometimes after that the DNS goes stale and sometimes teammates need to either refresh DNS or restart their laptop to refresh their DNS entrees.   

Hopefully it is working normally again for you and Suzanne..... however if it is not, we may need to try the laptop restart to refresh your DNS and/or verify VPN settings.   

Let me or the Service Desk know if you or Suzanne are still having trouble when you see this and we will do some more troubleshooting with you if needed.

The 2020 HRA for member 1667446 has a $0 balance.  Please send an idea in aha requesting review of the user experience when attempting to reimburse from $0 balance.  We probably should not be presenting the account as an option early in the flow.
Generally speaking, slowness often requires a system enhancement.  However, it this case, the performance may have been caused by the $0 balance.

close_notes: Hello, 

The members Haley Gyarmati (23108600), Bryon Humphrey (23108604), Donn Johnson (23108575), & Corey Leon (23108576) have been moved to the requested portal. 
The SQL update has been deployed and we separated the portals.  We were able to move the members into  #6782607. 
In the future we are not supposed to be moving clients over to a different employer, as the partner needs to send the updates in a file. 
For this case we were able to move them to the requested employer, but we do ask that the partner updates the members and their correct 
employer in the next file that is sent over or else the updates we made today will not remain "fixed" and will revert back to the original portal they were 
on as the files are removing the fix since they are not updated.  For future reference we usually do portal merges and we are not supposed to be moving members as I stated above.

close_notes: Hi Destiny, I have checked all settings on your email account dsullivan@healthequity.com and everything is set the same way that all other teammates email accounts are setup.   There are no restrictions on whom you can send to, or who can send to you.  The mailbox isn't full or anything like that, and everything else is correct with the settings for it on the server side.   

If you are unable to send emails to a specific email address, or multiple email addresses, then we would need some examples of those email addresses and the bounce-back error message you get when trying to send to them.   The bounce-back error message should tell us exactly why your email isn't getting delivered.   Or if you are unable to receive email from a specific email addresses, we would need those addresses and any bounce-back error messages that the sender on the other side gets.   

Since this isn't related to an access issue with your email account I am going to close out this I NEED ACCESS request since we have verified it was setup correctly.  If you can get those examples you can submit a new trouble ticket incident to Service Desk and we will investigate/troubleshoot the email sending/receiving issue thru that.    Thanks!

close_notes: Added the Apex integration to production per the instructions. 
description: Hi Lawrence and Danny,
 
I have been working with Philip Dunn to set up the integration for Apex.  

This is used for gathering employee data from NetSuite. In the future, the goal will be to use this tool/integration for 
granting and removing access into Concur for expense reporting. 

This integration will automate provisioning users in Concur, and will save
approximately 5000 service now tickets per year. 

I worked with the Apex team to set up the integration in NetSuite Sandbox 5.
They have done the necessary testing and are ready to connect to production.


Please approve the creation of the Apex Integration role in production (which
is only used by the ApexIntegration user):
 
The first set of permissions gives the integration user/role access – it will be able to read, but not modify employee data.
	Under Permissions->Lists: 
		Classes > View
		Departments > View
		Employee Record > View
		Employees > View
		Subsidiariew > View

The second set of permissions are necessary to set up token-based authentication.
	Under Permissions->Setup: 
		Access Token Management > Full
		Auto-Generated Numbers > Full
		Log in using Access Tokens > Full
		SOAP Web Services > Full
		User Access Tokens > Full
 
Also, please approve us setting up an Apex Integration that uses token based
authentication, as well as a  user token so that this user can log in via
token-based authentication (all in production). 

Please let us know if there are any questions.
 
Thanks,

I needed to reboot my laptop earlier today. When I tried to access the options on the power button (Restart, shut down, sleep, etc), I get an error and it tells me that there are currently no power options available.  Please see attached screenshot.
I never had this issue before. I'm not sure if this is related to the Emergency Maintenance that occurred last night. I know I'm not the only user affected.  Odette Beaulieu, Nicholas Jennings are experiencing the same issue. We no longer have the ability to restart, shutdown, etc.
How can this be corrected?
Thanks,
Veronica Carlton

Hi Erica,

I was able to reset my PW and was able to log onto the TCCard site. I was going to help with the card adjustments but I'm not able to load/unload cards that are expired on that site.

Michelle does the load/unload on the HCZ site and she has access to 'Balance Adjustment' which I don't have access to (see below screenshot from Michelle). Could I get your approval to have this access added to my account?

description: We have an issue where when the system is trying to create BankTransferLine rows, there is a BankAccountId that is 51 characters long and that table currently only accepts 50 characters.  We need to increase the max length of that column on the table.  Because this column is also part of a Filtered index, we have to drop the index before we make that schema change and then recreate the index after.  Luckily, this table isn't used by very many processes in the system and those processes are currently stopped because of this issue so dropping this index and rebuilding it shouldn't have much of an affect on the queries of the system (and this filtered index is mostly likely here for user use rather than system use due to the nature of the filter).  
When I rebuilt the index in the dev environment took around 10 minutes.  

Here's the change that I'd like to make:

I was able to add the folder *David as requested. I hadn't tried before, but it turns out that adding folders to shared mailboxes like this is as easy as right-clicking the Inbox of that mailbox, then selecting the New Folder option.

Anyone with access to the shared drive can add folders freely, although it may take some time for the folder to properly appear after you add it. It took a few hours to appear for me, but that was most likely due to the mailbox downloading emails on my computer slowing it down in the process.

(HCsz is the cardholder site) After months of struggling with FIS to get back in to the account, I'm in and need to add a few others to have this access to support varying requests.  The SD/UAA team are the only team with Ace High access we can add, remove and reset accounts.  The WFM team has Ace Low access to support password resets for customer service.  Generally no one else has access to Ace so the requests for this is low, however I'm a single point of failure and need a back up for everything.

I am requesting for Juan Elizondo and Julie Ciccarone to have Authorized Signer Access for the following banks shown below as well as T22 & T24 which I'm working on restoring my accounts still: –

This would allow them to request administrative access for the UAA and WFM teams as the requests come up.  These requests would still be approved by the IAM security team prior to Juan, Julie or myself taking action.  This particular request is really the BIG ONE and I want to cover the bases on since I am the only one with access, therefore the only one who can request it.

I will move this over to your queue to review and am available for any questions before I submit this.  The form details I have to agree to before submitted are below my signature and I can show you the site and or walk through anything if needed.

close_notes: To reiterate the issue:
-worked on some files that were syncing via OneDrive both relying on autosave and manual saves while working
-restarted computer due to lag
-files that were worked on show last modified dates of days prior to when they were actually worked on - this was mirrored in version history
-ultimately, work was missing because of this

As far as I can tell, it appears that OneDrive may have had some trouble that the restart fixed and that might have affected autosaves, but manual saves should have continued to work due to the file living locally on Corie's computer.

I did not see any missing data in version history or in Corie's OneDrive Recycle Bin.
We found copies of the file with the missing data saved as copies in the root of Corie's OneDrive folder.

As the data was found, this ticket will be closed.

close_notes: Resolved, Advised TM how to report issues in SNow. 
description: Hi,
would you please review the workflow of New Subscription Tickets in Service Now to streamline the process of transitioning tasks from reporting team to data ops.
In the current process when request is created it creates 2 open tasks for reporting team and data ops. Data ops must wait for the reporting team to finish their task in order to complete file mover setup. There is also an approval that is sent out to the request which is either not needed or is not functioning as intended.
Currently there are two issues  with the workflow. 
1. Data OPS is confused as to why the task is open for them when the subscription have not been setup with reporting team, there are possibly  notification issues as well which causes a delay for data ops to work the ticket as they are not aware of when the details are provided.
2. There is an approval that is sent out to the requester when the reporting team is done with subscription, which is somewhat is causing the confusion as there is no necessity to approve the subscription until it's fully complete with the file mover and that data ops already has a request that is open. 

example can be reviewed  RITM0013540

Last night while I was trying to log into one of my laptops, it would not let me authenticate to the VPN. After several repeated attempts my account got locked out. This morning I'm able to log into the laptops at least but I'm unable to authenticate against the VPN. Which renders them mostly useless I've not changed my password today. About a week ago it did change. But I'm unable to work. I would like to be able to authenticate to the VPN again please.

Subject: COA - Please approve Department adjustment

Hi Danny and Cameron,

Can you please approve us to re-open, adjust, and then immediately re-close the cost center below? There are approx. $44K of costs which need to be moved into Dept 31030. I'm not sure why transactions were able to post to an inactive department at all, and will keep you in the loop when we find out more.

Cost center #	Cost center Name	FSLI Mapping	Action	Notes
31020	Enterprise Sales	Sales and Marketing	Reopen, then Inactivate	We inactivated this cost center in February, but NetSuite still allowed credit memos to post there. We are following up with IT on this issue and hope to understand why this was possible and resolve it in June. In the meantime, we would like to re-open the CC to reclass any expenses booked there in FY22, and then immediately close it.

This did not cause a reporting error in Q1, as the new CC for these transactions (31030) also maps to Sales and Marketing costs.

Thank you,

Her Jabber had updated and forced a laptop restart when she went back into CX this issue started.  I have seen this before, and cant explain why, but if we exit CX, then re-launch, the option to add Harmony will show back up.   We did that, and it did, and confirmed Harmony was good after.

We'd need a new domain service account to be used by TFS to connect to SQL Servers and execute SQL scripts. Once domain account created it will go to SQL DBA team to create SQL Server logins.

close_notes: The report is only meant to pull in results for the current calendar month. If you would like to see data for a different time frame you need to click the funnel on the report and change the date range you would like to see.  Ranges can be for specific time frames like "This Month" or custom in which you specify the dates.  If you want to save your results after you modify the dates you'll need to do a Save As and change the folder location to private reports.  If you try and save it somewhere else you are likely to get an error message saying you don't have permission to create reports in the given folder.

If the time clock option is still missing from ADP for you and this continues to occur in all browsers, then I am afraid that this is something that us on the Service Desk will be unable to correct for you. Unless it starts working in any one of your browsers, you will need to reach out to the People Team at people@healthequity.com to have this addressed as they manage ADP and ADP support.

    I can actually access GP now. My only issue is with Net Suites. I log in, tells me my pw is invalid and sends me the link to change it. I change it. it tells me I was successful and to go log in. I go log in and it tells me my pw is invalid.

    Done that about 8 times in the last 3 days.

    You need to go through OKTA for Netsuite 
​[11:36 AM] Cindy Cross
    okay, My computer recently crashed with the latest VPN upgrade so I've been working with a new one. The IT guy that I was working with never told me that. I'd been accessing it as one of my favorites in IE forever and he said all of my favorites should work just fine. He didn't know to tell me I had to go through Okta now. Alrighty then.........I'm in now! Ugh, that was so simple................THANK YOU SO MUCH

Can you help out on this access request for Verint?  

Tanya Cornforth: I require this access as a Classic Client Services trainer. I need to be able to access recorded calls for Classic Employer Service representatives on HSA and RA (Reimbursement Account) Calls. This will aid in the training process for new and cross-training teammates. I am unsure of who's access needs to be mirrored. I currently have (or have had access) to Verint for V5 Client Service representative call access in the past. I do not require this any longer. Instead, I need to be able to access HQY Classic Employer Service/Client Services calls for HSAs and RA benefits.

@Nikki McCubbins  Heads up All Verint access requests for internal teammates are managed by WFM.  The service now, service desk teams push all requests to WFM for management currently.

I need to be able to access recorded calls for Classic Employer Service representatives on HSA and RA (Reimbursement Account) Calls. This will aid in the training process for new and cross-training teammates. I am unsure of who's access needs to be mirrored. I currently have (or have had access) to Verint for V5 Client Service representative call access in the past. I do not require this any longer. Instead, I need to be able to access HQY Classic Employer Service/Client Services calls for HSAs and RA benefits.

Your HCSz password has been reset to: 9876

The following are the minimum requirements for creating an HCSz system password:

•         Must be eight characters, no blanks or spaces
•         Must use one alpha and one numeric character
•         Must include one of the following National characters: @  #  $
•         The three National characters cannot be at the beginning or end of the password
•         Passwords must be changed at your normal password change interval and cannot be changed again within 1 day of the last change
•         You may not reuse a password that you have used in the previous 16 password iterations
•         You cannot use your user id as a part of your password
•         You cannot use three repeating characters
 
Review carefully as the site does not tell you the requirements or what is missing when you select a new/confirm password.  If you do not meet the requirements it simply states inconsistent user ID combo.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  Thanks!

There should already be a rule for access to corpsql1a on the subnet, but we have a few more servers that need it. So it is probably best to just open the whole subnet for the future in case we use create more servers. Only servers on this subnet are VMware Horizon backend servers.

I do not see any updates for the ticket from last night. I just checked Janae's account, and I can see that it shows that it was last reset at 2:15a CST on 3/9. If the reset attempt shown in the screenshot provided was done with 24 hours of that reset, then that would be the cause of the error message that Janae received. Please have Janae try resetting their password again as it has been over 24 hours since that last reset.

We updated the logic between the "DMZ Archive Onetime DSS UBOC Exception files" and "DMZ DSS UBOC Cleared Checks File to Frontier" MoveIT jobs to prevent future files from going missing. While investigating the scheduling between the jobs for an overlap we noticed that the "DMZ Archive Onetime DSS UBOC Exception files" job which is meant to store the archive copy of the original file had too much of a general search criteria that it couldn't differentiate between the archive copy file versus the original production file. The "DMZ DSS UBOC Cleared Checks File to Frontier" job which delivers the file to the destination folder creates an archived copy for the other job to store and now with the revision made that archive job should not accidentally delete/remove the original file before it gets delivered. The Word document attached below has screenshots of the changes made if needed for reference.

Hi Elizabeth,
Here is the information that I have on SSPR registration, let me know if you would rather have a quick call to review this as there are some complexities to it:
Accounts synced to our M365 tenant: 8477+
Accounts that are enabled for SSPR (could register): 4470
Accounts that are not registered for SSPR: 1434
Accounts that are registered for SSPR but effectively can't use it: 287 (Note: These are teammates that don't have a mobile phone and app registered which makes SSPR in the event of a lockout/forgot password unusable)
Accounts that are registered for SSPR and can use it today: 2751

One last thing to note is there are at least 1300+ accounts that are synced to our tenant that can't use SSPR due to them being vendors.

Yes, the receptionist and a member of IT will be onsite there in Tempe tomorrow.  They should be able to buzz you into the lobby where there is a table for no-contact drop offs.

It looks like we haven't received any incoming faxes to the Choice Strategies fax public folder since 10/1, so there wouldn't be anything forwarded/to test.
I'd say we can go ahead and close this ticket at this point. All other Choice Strategies related items have been decommissioned.
description: Currently, all faxes intended for the Choice platform go into the "Faxes" public folder under Choice Strategies:

Thus far we've always had someone manually reviewing and forwarding to the appropriate destination. However, with the decommissioning of the Alegeus platform (and extremely low volume that comes into this folder), we'd like to request automation to have these redirected. Could it be set up so that all documents received at this folder automatically get forwarded via fax2mail to 1-877-220-3248?

That is our v5 claim appeals line, which is where all Choice mail is also getting forwarded.

close_notes: After review with NetSuite development and SalesForce adminstrators going over set ups in both systems, it seems there is most likely a set up issue with the platform. In PSQ 578744, there are plan types that appear to be bundles that do not exist in NetSuite and do not match what was sold on the contract in SalesForce. DCFSA item code should be 10017; per contract, it should not be combined as shown in rows 4, 5, 9, 10, 14, 15 or 19, 20. If the set up was to be a bundle of HC/DC plnas, that item code should be 10018. At this time, there is no bundled billable item that includes HRA. It may be easiest to email LWW-inbound@healthequity.com to have PSQ 578744 re-opened and plan types corrected as referenced so documentation has continuity and platform has what matches the contract.

Hey Cassie,

There were multiple manual updates done to the RA account that the balance was out of sync. Whenever you see something like this, I would suggest to submit a SQL request to the OA team first to recalculate the member's RA balance to see if system would auto correct balance after RA recalculation.

The member's FSA balance now shows correct.
description: Becca Wagner researched and responded to Mindy's email: Looking into the account and at the case notes, the member states that when they checked their account it showed $422.37 was available in the 2021 FSA.

There is a card transaction for $422.37 with dates that are outside of the plan year. This transaction was originally marked overpaid due to the dates of service.
This could cause the member to believe that there was more in their account when it was actually exhausted.

The claims were processed and the system somehow thought that there were funds and it allowed the claims to processed but did not recoup the overpaid amount. (I am not sure how this happened as its outside of RA's knowledge).

The transaction was then incorrectly marked as member matched which removed the overpayment and made the account negative.

Linda partially moved claim 0114 to the HRA to use up the remaining funds and lessen the negative amount but that still left the account -$130.45.
 
Mindy, I rematched/offset the overpaid amount of $422.37 to claims 0079, 0092 and 0100 . The member will need to return $130.45.

I recently came across a product called Auto-Update for JAMF that would help us patch macOS devices. This product would be really helpful in making sure we're up to date with both applications and macOS releases. I'm attaching the white papers and guide for this product for you guys to review.
 
DataJar is a UK based company and a very close partner with JAMF and is one of a handful of companies that has JAMF's thumbs up to assist with JAMF setups. They also develop products like AutoUpdate to assist JAMF admins with their tasks, such as software and OS patches.
 
If you look at the attached white papers, they go into detail about how they secure their service w/ our JAMF instance. I have a contact, chris@datajar.co.uk if you do have any further technical questions or security questions.

This will allow teammates to browse to the site, however this will NOT grant SharePoint permissions to the teammate, as that can then be handled by the SharePoint administrators/UAA to grant the appropriate access.

Hey team, 

The carryover was forced intentionally for these plans right around 12/9/2021 to prevent card issues from occurring once we reach the next plan year (HCSZ our card vendor can't support more than 2 plans. It will only support carryover balance + current plan year. The same process was followed the year prior as well due to the extended run out. In December, carryover was forced. This wasn't just for plans ending 12/31 and wasn't considered as being a monthly process (based on plan year end date). As I understand it, due to the volume and level of effort required by product and DIS, that wasn't feasible. Member's can still get their claims processed for the prior plan year as one off. @Kendall Hall, correct me if I'm wrong, but this would just be a matter of creating this adjustment to move balance in the exact amount of the claim, then a case to claims team to process the claim? I think we want to prevent mass updates and handle these as one offs. Would you be able to provide feedback on this before there is any reversal of carryover funds completed?

Thank you!

I also disabled exclusive control modes for bother her headset mic and speakers in the event that another app was muting her devices.
I changed her Windows Communications settings to Do Nothing so that her call volume does not drop when a call comes in.
Lastly, I reset her Windows app volume settings to equalize everything with her system settings - Jabber was showing up at a lower volume prior to this.

INC0128250
I added Bug 81362: HSA Admin Fee - Erroneous amount billed and corrected in the following month
Please work with Product for priority.  Yan Gao is the Product Owner.
Thanks!

description: The example appears to show If we have a historical PartnerAmount we use the first EmployerAmount without date filtering then refund the following month based on the date filtered EmployerAmount.

StartDate="0001-01-01T00:00:00" EndDate="2011-01-01T00:00:00"
<FeeCalculation xsi:type="HSAAdminFeeCalculation" PartnerAmount="2.95"

StartDate="2020-06-01T00:00:00" EndDate="9999-12-31T00:00:00"
EmployerAmount="1.25" 

So in this scenario we're seeing June 2021 bill $2 and refund $0.75 for May 2021 on the same invoice.
If this is the issue, I am guessing we have two issues.  One, we route to the Partner Fee logic for fee schedules that have ended.  Two, we are likely doing a first or default if the Partner fee schedule is past.  Working with development to confirm.

description: Hello! We're working on deploying our new Identity Governance Application to replace Omada, which is SailPoint IdentityNow. In order to integrate with key systems (Azure AD, M365, Azure DevOps, etc) I'm requesting a new application registration for IdentityNow, along with credentials so we can establish connectivity.

1. Specifically, I'd be looking to have a new application registered within Azure AD (could be named IdentityNow) and to be supplied the domain name, and the client id and client secret associated with the registration.
The application will also need to have application permissions applied to it for the Microsoft Graph API, with Directory.ReadWriteAll permissions.

I've included instructions below, and attached documentation from SailPoint for further reference. Please reach out if you need more info and I can go into further detail.

Thanks for your help!

Registration on Azure
1. Log into the Azure portal
2. Select Azure Active Directory in the left pane.
3. Click on App registrations.
4. Click New registration.
5. On the Register an application page, in the Name field, enter the name of the
application that you want to set up. For example, SailPointAzureADManagement.
6. In the Supported account types, set up accounts on the basis of users, eligible to
avail that application or the API.
7. (This is optional.) Set up the URL in Redirect URI, to have the successful response
after authentication. You can use the following format:
http://domainName/GraphWebapp
NOTE: Source does not use the URL mentioned above, the above example is just a
place-holder and does not impact functionality.
8. Click Register. An Application is created. On the App page the Application (client)
ID, and other details are displayed. Note down this ID.
9. On the left-hand panel, select Certificates & secrets. On the Certificates & secrets
page, in the Client secrets section, click New client secret.
10. On the Add a client secret page, enter the Description to generate a secret,
choose the validity duration in the Expires list. Click Add. Note down the value of the
secret that you have just created.

Application Permissions
1. Click API permissions in Azure Active Directory console. Click Add a permission.
2. On the Request API permissions page, you will see a list of supported APIs. click
Microsoft Graph API.
3. Choose Application permissions under What type of permissions does your
application require?
4. Under Select permissions, choose "Directory.ReadWriteAll" . Click Add permissions.
5. In Grant consent, click Grant admin consent for your configuration and

Subject: RE: INC0194732 - FTP blocked - status / resolution?

Yes – this is resolved – I apologize for the confusion!

Coral was coming from a different external IP address through the VPN than me and our SFTP server had blocked that IP address but not the one I was coming through, so it worked for me but not her. I fixed this by removing that on our SFTP server.

This confusion was exacerbated by the fact that there's still not a "template" of user access rights for Luum folks within the HQY network. As a result, we've hit a number of cases in which not all of our engineers have the same rights to hit various websites, or our Azure endpoints in Azure Service Bus, or whatever. That's why we initially thought the problem was on the HQY networking side and it was another instance of that occurring.

Tyler Simpson is working with Erica Anderson on getting that "template" setup for our engineering employee roles to remove that issue entirely. I'll also take an action item to always check our own configuration first when the issue specifically relates to SFTP access, as SFTP is the only thing of this nature in which Luum *is* the endpoint (as opposed to it being some Microsoft resource in Azure or whatever), is controlling access by IP (on our server), and is proactively preventing access from certain addresses.

Thank you!
-Matt

If anyone that was seeing issues is still seeing issues, ask them to sign out of VMWare completely, then re-log back in and see if the issues are normalized.   If there are still any issues, please get a full list of affected and we will investigate/escalate.  Please include any screenshots or errors that are seen too.

David worked with team yesterday afternoon and discovered that the platforms that were not working did not have the required import sources setup.  He scheduled a meeting with Juanita and Sam today where we found that they had not processed files in a while through this method and had been manually entering them.  The team helped walk Sam through setting up the import sources for each database that was missing and Sam was able to verify that he could drop files and see the batches now.  Closing story.

We attempted to review the FTP folder for client "Benton Fire District # 4" however no folder was found so there is no FTP access to terminate. Additionally, we ran logs for the files that were listed in the ticket however no results appeared when checking the past 90+ days. Usually when we cannot find any activity for the past 90 days with the file name, this indicates that the file was uploaded to the Employer site instead of our FTP site as there is an option to do this for PSF files. We will go ahead and close this ticket as no further actions can be taken on our end.

We attempted to review the FTP folder for client "Conley Rose Pc" however no folder was found so there is no FTP access to terminate. Additionally, we ran logs for the files that were listed in the ticket however no results appeared when checking the past 90+ days. Usually when we cannot find any activity for the past 90 days with the file name, this indicates that the file was uploaded to the Employer site instead of our FTP site as there is an option to do this for PSF files. We will go ahead and close this ticket as no further actions can be taken on our end.

I checked with our Legacy HQY team members and was advised they don't host a separate Concur platform. All Company sponsored Concur profiles are still via the old WageWorks platform, however, a new login will generate to whatever E-mail address someone shares a sheet to. Your license profile is attached to your Wageworks E-mail and linked through Okta. For ease of use, I would recommend continuing to have items shared to this address for the time being. We are unable to see sheets that were shared historically, but if you can provide the names of the sheets you need we can help locate their owners for you. Since the system is self-administered, those owners would need to re-share the sheets to you. Let us know if you have a list of sheets and we can look into these for you.

Thank you

How does this affect me?
•	You will not need to sign in to Amazon Web Services using a separate username and password going forward.
•	You can access your Single Sign-On application by browsing to https://myapplications.microsoft.com, and selecting the Amazon Web Services icon shown below.
•	Here is also shortcut link you can favorite that will sign you directly in AWS using AzureAD:

I've added Teams Audio for Shawn. It may take up to 24 hours and team member should reboot  machine. Team member should get an email notifying them when its provided. If the number doesn't pop after 24 hours it's because we are out of licenses. When we get more it'll start working correctly.

The following are the minimum requirements for creating an HCSz system password:

•         Must be eight characters, no blanks or spaces
•         Must use one alpha and one numeric character
•         Must include one of the following National characters: @  #  $
•         The three National characters cannot be at the beginning or end of the password
•         Passwords must be changed at your normal password change interval and cannot be changed again within 1 day of the last change
•         You may not reuse a password that you have used in the previous 16 password iterations

Review carefully as the site does not tell you the requirements or what is missing when you select a new/confirm password.  If you do not meet the requirements it simply states inconsistent user ID combo.

close_notes: Teri called into the Service Desk.   We went to teams.microsoft.com in her browser to test, and Teams worked normally there.   So it seems its related to the Teams app being the issue.   I noticed the laptop showed an update of 10 hours, and the issue started today, and there were lots of updates being pushed out to laptops today.... so we started with a laptop restart for good measure  before trying to uninstall the Teams App and clear the cache.   Actually before the restart, we checked for Windows Updates and it installed about 20 or so, THEN we restarted.   After the restart, Teri verified that Teams was working normally once again.   Issue resolved!

I believe this ticket should be sent to the SRE Team.  Clients HSA Admin Fees are missing from the Invoices.  They have FSA on V5, HSA on Classic and are billed out of NetSuite. The clients are set up correctly in Salesforce and in Classic.  They have been receiving invoices with the HSA fees included since the BNY Mellon migration.  Why would they be missing the fees for the invoice generated on 5/25/2021.  DriV has been missing the April and May Admin Fees.

Please research to see why these clients admin fee invoice is missing their HSA Admin Fees.  Could this be a larger issue and more than these 4 clients be missing their HSA Admin Fees?

Hi Paul and Fuad,

Before I delete, I just want to make sure I'm deleting the correct records. I can either delete ALL WF1 usage created 5/10 and 5/11 (3364 records in total); or I can delete the records that were uploaded or edited by Fuad:
•	TC edits (77 records)
•	AF edits (1887 records)
•	Missing usage (119 records)

See attached for detail – the three tabs in yellow are the three sets of usage data – new or edited.  The first tab is the full WF1 usage (highlighted in orange).

@Paul Derewicz  - please confirm which set of data I am approved to delete and I will start working on that.

Thanks,

Hi Fuad,

Is it just the new usage records you imported (count of 119) or is it the edits as well? 

Please confirm which sets of records need to be reversed out – I will export from NetSuite and request Paul's approval for us to delete.

Hi Shashank,

Addisyn passed along a message that FedEx would not accept your full equipment return (Laptop, Peripherals and Monitors)?   We have unfortunately seen this before on occasion, and it seems to be something specific to the FedEx locations in question.  It's either their specific interpretation of the RMA service and what it entails or the training of the specific FedEx representative from what we have seen.  We have successfully RMAed hundreds of workstations using this same template and this seems to be a rare exception rather than the rule, so my apologies for the misunderstanding.  

So we have the following options available:
•	I can generate additional RMAs and describe them separately as 2 monitors and a Misc. Box.  There is not actually an option which we set for "Laptop" so I am not sure where FedEx gets that, but it's not the first time I've heard that.  When we setup the RMA it askes for the number of returns and the weight.   Which we intentionally overestimate at 14-15 lbs to cover monitors and laptop.  They may or may not accept them.
o	Are you still at the following address?
4897 Chateau Dr.
San Diego CA 92117
•	Or if you have the original boxes for the monitors and have them repackaged in them, I can send you a set of 4 return shipping labels which you can adhere to the exterior the boxes and drop at any FedEx Location.  But that's only an option for pre-boxed returns.
•	Or you can return the laptop and charger only using the RMA you already have.  We do not actually require the return of the Monitors and peripherals (mouse/keyboard/headset), but while using RMAs we provide for them as a 'just in-case' option and usually FedEx accepts it all.  
o	As for what to do with the monitors, most communities do have local eRecycling drop-off locations available.  A quick google search for eRecylcing or eWaste in your community should point you to the nearest locations.  Also, if you have a local BestBuy, I believe the GeekSquad Service Desks accept 2 items per visit for eRecycling.
o	You are also free to keep the monitors for your future use.  They are fairly current as far as monitors go and DisplayPort cables are the industry standard for connecting to docking stations, ect. and should absolutely be re-usable.

Let me know how you would like to proceed and I can assist you with that?

Thank you,

We also turned off Fast Start on her laptop as it was stopping her computer from shutting down and restarting normally which was causing a few programs to give error messages.

Good Morning Sarah! I understand you're having some trouble creating a case for a member who is migrating from the WinFlexOne Platform to v5. I did some checking (logged in as you in SF) and I see what's happening. Your My Open Cases view is taking up a portion of your scree, so you need to shrink that panel. Below are steps you can take to close out of the alert message at the top of the screen so that you can access the New Participant Case button to create your case. 
1.	Click on the small arrow on the My Open Cases panel, that will collapse that panel temporarily (you can expand it again if you wish). 
2.	After reading the migration alert, you can close it out using the gray X at the top right of the box:

Please work with Implementations team who set up the Product (Prod_HRAFedEE_PresbyterianHPNonintegrated) tied to reimbursement plan rp_2451494_00. Product Prod_HRAFedEE_PresbyterianHPNonintegrated was created with Partner record = "P_PresbyterianHPNonIntegrated". Partner is case sensitive and should be P_PresbyterianHPNonintegrated. (see small i letter in Nonintegrated). This is what's causing the blue screen error because system can't find the partner P_PresbyterianHPNonIntegrated.

This issue significantly impacts my work flow processes because Salesforce is a major application that I  use for every call. Screens freeze for 85% of  searching, logging, clicking, etc.

She may also have the option to go by an office location if she is nearby to one.  Rochelle mentioned that Jennifer is near Draper.

Hey team,
 
Spoke with Shane regarding this, to match our current implementation of AWS in Azure AD, I have created an AAD group: AAD-SSO-AmazonWebServices-AWSNoAccess which has no permissions to anything within our AWS tenant.
 
Additionally, this will still require them to be prompted for MFA with Microsoft Authenticator for them to get in.
 
Let me know if anything else is needed.

close_notes: Worked with Melissa on this issue.  She said that her WiFi was not taking the WiFi password after the update installed on the laptop.  I asked Melissa to try wired again, and this time bypass the docking station and plug the cable directly into the side of the laptop.   We did that, and she was able to get back on the VPN.   We confirmed resources were working normally again on the wired connection.  Technically we only support the wired connection, and if the WiFi isnt taking the password it may be beyond our support, however we can perhaps try to forget the WiFi network and re-install the wifi drivers or update them and see if that allows WiFi function again.

This source email does not appear genuine, please do not click any links in the email. If HealthEquity Security Operations believes your account to be compromised, you will normally be contacted directly by a Service Desk Technician. If you believe this to be spam or a phishing attempt, you can click the "Report Phishing" icon in the top menu bar or your Outlook. If you do not have the "Report Phishing" button, you can submit a separate Service Desk ticket to have it added.

The 2021 HRA transaction that's causing the error in the Funding Ledger report is transaction TransferlineID "dj4a3qt" that was created on 8/18/2021 - that's why only if you select/include 8/18/2021 when pulling the report, the error occurs. This transaction that's causing the error is linked to the scheduled item and payment that were created manually by HQY internal agent "user_tmcdonald1" - I believe it's a Taegan Mcdonald (Claims Examiner).  The problem with this transaction "dj4a3qt" is it doesn't have a reimbursement account tied to it - it's showing empty in the Transferline table. It should be linked to ReimbursementAccountId 3129752_RA009. See attached screenshot "bad transferline i3vsjz0.JPG". The portion highlighted in yellow should be showing the ReimbursementAccountID. I'm assuming they missed to add the ReimbursementAccountId for this transaction when they created it. I confirmed that this is the only transaction having this issue under this employer. Please work with the team who created this transaction (Taegan Mcdonald) and have them update it and get the ReimbursementAccountId linked to the transaction.

Hi Brittany,
Just to give you an update on this, the HRA 2021 report is breaking when selecting or including 8/18/2021 transactions in the report. The only time report breaks is when 8/18/2021 is pulled. I'm still not sure what transaction is causing the error but I will continue to troubleshoot. As a workaround, you can modify the report and update dates example if you want to run August 2021 data, you can set dates 8/1/2020 - 8/17/2021, skip 8/18/2021. Then run 8/19/2021 - 8/31/2021. You should be able to pull previous months data as well.

•         You cannot use three repeating characters

Review carefully as the site does not tell you the requirements or what is missing when you select a new/confirm password.  If you do not meet the requirements it simply states inconsistent user ID combo.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

description: Hello,

I am in Arizona and i would like to have a desk setup for the Tempe office. I have spoken with Evan Ault about this and he agrees that it would be good to have this setup. I dont always have the best internet service when i am at work. I have run into many issue with Cox previously and i want to have a plan B if my internet goes out while i am working. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,

I'm, sorry but you are not a approved Corporate SmartSheet user.  Please discuss your needs with your manager and if approved please submit a new ticket and attach the approval and indicate what Smartsheet access you need. 



If approved there are two ways you can have this access. 

1.  Licensed SmartSheet user where you can share sheets  (annual cost $225 and requires VP approval)

2.  Regular SmartSheet user where you can create your own and see shared sheets from a licensed user.

Please try this and let us know if it works.  Added you to HQY\dm_DataManagement per your leaders approval.  The EDW team did not confirm if this requires HEQ or HQY domain to access, so since you do not have HEQ we are trying with HQY.  Let us know how it goes.  If it does not work we will try again to see if the EDW can confirm HEQ domain is required and we will update our documentation and get you set up.

Thank you

close_notes: Craig reached out to me via Teams to send me a screenshot of a failed Okta login for Dinesh. He mentioned that he tried using the account recovery link below the login, but was unable to access the account successfully. Both Dinesh and Karthik had their passwords reset, but they were still having trouble logging in.

I reset both passwords and emailed them directly to William Nelson so that he can relay that information to them. In addition to that, it appears that Dinesh's account had expired. I added that info to the email with Dinesh's new login information along with info on how William can have this account extended. It appears that Dinesh's account expiration notice slipped through the cracks due to his leader being listed as Chris Jeffs who is no longer with the company.

As both logins have been addressed and should work once the instructions I sent to William have been passed along and followed, I will go ahead and close out this ticket. If Karthik has further trouble with his login over the next 3 days, this ticket can still be re-opened and I will follow up.

Thank you,
